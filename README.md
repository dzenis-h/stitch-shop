# Stitch Shop 🏪

## Overview 👀

Stitch Shop is a basic React app built for the sole purpose of getting to know the MongoDB Stitch serverless platform. It's an online shop of sorts. After you register as a user, the admin needs to approve you before you can log in. In the meantime, you can use the already approved account:

**Email:** test@test.com  
**Password:** 123456
